     * @version 2.3.0
     *
     * The Cancelable interface defines a common method of adding general <i>disable-and-exit</i>
     * semantics to some object. By cancel()ing a Cancelable object, a request is
     * made to disable that object.
     *
     * <b>Disabling</b>
     *
     * A cancel()ed object may not necessarily abort it work immediately. Often, it much more
     * elegant for a cancel()ed object to complete handling whatever responsibilities have
     * been assigned to it, but it will <i>not</i> take on any new responsibility.
     *
     * <b>Exiting</b>
     *
     * A cancel()ed should complete its responsibilities as soon as possible.
     * Canceling is not only a request to stop taking on new responsibility, and to
     * complete its current responsibility. Its also a request to complete dealing with its
     * current responsibilities, quickly when possible.
