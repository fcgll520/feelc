     *
     * The Waitable interface defines a common method of adding generic <i>wait</i> semantics
     * to a class.
     *
     * <b>Waiting</b>
     *
     * An object implementing the Waitable interface externalizes a mechanism for testing
     * some internal condition. Another object may <i>wait()</i>s for a Waitable object;
     * in doing so, it wait()s for that condition to become true by blocking the caller
     * while the condition is false.
     *
     * For example, a Condition is Waitable object that extends <i>wait</i> semantics
     * so that wait()ing means a thread is blocked until some external stimulus
     * specifically performs an operation on the Condition to make its internal condition true.
     * (serialization aside)
     *
     * A Barrier extends <i>wait</i> semantics so that wait()ing mean waiting for other
     * waiters, and may include automatically resetting the condition once a wait is complete.
     *

     * @see Barrier
