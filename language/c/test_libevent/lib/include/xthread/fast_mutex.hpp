     *
     * A FastMutex is a small fast implementation of a non-recursive, mutually exclusive
     * Lockable object. This implementation is a bit faster than the other Mutex classes
     * as it involved the least overhead. However, this slight increase in speed is
     * gained by sacrificing the robustness provided by the other classes.
     *
     * A FastMutex has the useful property of not being interruptable; that is to say
     * that acquire() and tryAcquire() will not throw Interrupted_Exceptions.
     *

     * <b>Scheduling</b>
     *
     * Scheduling is left to the operating systems and may vary.
     *
     * <b>Error Checking</b>
     *
     * No error checking is performed, this means there is the potential for deadlock.
